# SOHO

## About Soho Strategy

Soho Strategy (**SOHO**) is a full-service digital strategy agency and product studio, set up in early 2008.

SOHO stopped taking new clients in December 2018 to focus more fully on [HASH](https://hash.ai/).

Exiting clients can continue to access private repositories in the `sohostrategy` organization on GitHub, or can contact their account manager to arrange for the transfer of these to their own namespaces. Migration support is available.

## About this repository

This public repository contains the holding page at [sohostrategy.com](https://sohostrategy.com/) which replaced the previous website in July 2022. The microsite is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
